# MobilityForecast


## Narrtive 

Multi-Modadl Mobility Datasets with external factors are lacking -> Creating one dataset with multiple modes of transport and external conditions can help in desiging more efficient urban mobility systems. 

1. independent dataset for taxi
2. independent dataset for citi bike
3. independent dataset for weather
4. combining these independent datasets to condinitionally generate demand data. for eg: mon, rain, 5 pm, demand on taxi? demand on bike? 

date, (Month), Day, time, PU location, DO location, weather, citi bike demand, taxi demand
