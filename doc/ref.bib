	abstract = {Ridership modeling is a growing field critical for Intelligent Transportation. Accurate traffic prediction and early surge detection are vital components in designing public transit dispatching systems. However, modeling Spatio-temporal traffic at a small geographic scale and fine time granularity is challenging due to the sparseness, low signal-to-noise ratio, and the large dimensionality of the mobility network data. We propose a framework for edge-level traffic prediction to tackle these challenges, which addresses the curse of dimensionality through a pipeline of appropriate network aggregation, nonlinear modeling, and final edge-level disaggregation. Subsequently, we show that the low-dimensional aggregated space model residuals are more suited for anomaly detection than raw ridership data. Our framework is evaluated using the for-hire vehicle and taxi ridership dataset from the two airports in New York City, experimenting with different network aggregation techniques and modeling paradigms. The results reinstate the superiority of the proposed pipeline in ridership prediction and anomaly detection compared with single-model methods, and help build up scenario design for transportation simulation and planning.},

	abstract = {Urban dispersal events are processes where an unusually large number of people leave the same area in a short period. Early prediction of dispersal events is important in mitigating congestion and safety risks and making better dispatching decisions for taxi and ride-sharing fleets. Existing work mostly focuses on predicting taxi demand in the near future by learning patterns from historical data. However, they fail in case of abnormality because dispersal events with abnormally high demand are non-repetitive and violate common assumptions such as smoothness in demand change over time. Instead, in this paper we argue that dispersal events follow a complex pattern of trips and other related features in the past, which can be used to predict such events. Therefore, we formulate the dispersal event prediction problem as a survival analysis problem. We propose a two-stage framework (DILSA), where a deep learning model combined with survival analysis is developed to predict the probability of a dispersal event and its demand volume. We conduct extensive case studies and experiments on the NYC Yellow taxi dataset from 2014-2016. Results show that DILSA can predict events in the next 5 hours with F1-score of 0:7 and with average time error of 18 minutes. It is orders of magnitude better than the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for taxi demand prediction.},

	abstract = {Traffic prediction has drawn increasing attention in AI research field due to the increasing availability of large-scale traffic data and its importance in the real world. For example, an accurate taxi demand prediction can assist taxi companies in pre-allocating taxis. The key challenge of traffic prediction lies in how to model the complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Although both factors have been considered in modeling, existing works make strong assumptions about spatial dependence and temporal dynamics, i.e., spatial dependence is stationary in time, and temporal dynamics is strictly periodical. However, in practice the spatial dependence could be dynamic (i.e., changing from time to time), and the temporal dynamics could have some perturbation from one period to another period. In this paper, we make two important observations: (1) the spatial dependencies between locations are dynamic; and (2) the temporal dependency follows daily and weekly pattern but it is not strictly periodic for its dynamic temporal shifting. To address these two issues, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Network (STDN), in which a flow gating mechanism is introduced to learn the dynamic similarity between locations, and a periodically shifted attention mechanism is designed to handle long-term periodic temporal shifting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that tackle both issues in a unified framework. Our experimental results on real-world traffic datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Accurately predicting taxi demand is of great significance to passengers, drivers, ride-hailing platforms and urban managers. Most of the existing studies only forecast the taxi demand for pick-up and separate the interaction between spatial correlation and temporal correlation. In this paper, we first analyze the historical data and select three highly relevant parts for each time interval, namely closeness, period and trend. We then construct a multi-task learning component and extract the common spatiotemporal feature by treating the taxi pick-up prediction task and drop-off prediction task as two related tasks. With the aim of fusing spatiotemporal features of historical data, we conduct feature embedding by attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) and capture the correlation between taxi pick-up and drop-off with 3D ResNet. Finally, we combine external factors to simultaneously predict the taxi demand for pick-up and drop-off in the next time interval. Experiments conducted on real datasets in Chengdu present the effectiveness of the proposed method and show better performance in comparison with state-of-the-art models.},

	abstract = {In big cities, taxi service is imbalanced. In some areas, passengers wait too long for a taxi, while in others, many taxis roam without passengers. Knowledge of where a taxi will become available can help us solve the taxi demand imbalance problem. In this paper, we employ a holistic approach to predict taxi demand at high spatial resolution. We showcase our techniques using two real-world data sets, yellow cabs and Uber trips in New York City, and perform an evaluation over 9,940 building blocks in Manhattan. Our approach consists of two key steps. First, we use entropy and the temporal correlation of human mobility to measure the demand uncertainty at the building block level. Second, to identify which predictive algorithm can approach the theoretical maximum predictability, we implement and compare three predictors: the Markov predictor (a probability-based predictive algorithm), the Lempel-Ziv-Welch predictor (a sequence-based predictive algorithm), and the Neural Network predictor (a predictive algorithm that uses machine learning). The results show that predictability varies by building block and, on average, the theoretical maximum predictability can be as high as 83\%. The performance of the predictors also vary: the Neural Network predictor provides better accuracy for blocks with low predictability, and the Markov predictor provides better accuracy for blocks with high predictability. In blocks with high maximum predictability, the Markov predictor is able to predict the taxi demand with an 89\% accuracy, 11\% better than the Neural Network predictor, while requiring only 0.03\% computation time. These findings indicate that the maximum predictability can be a good metric for selecting prediction algorithms.},

	abstract = {Ride hailing is a representative practice of rapidly developing sharing economy, which not only brings people convenience on mobility, but also benefits the utilization of vehicular resources. For ride-hailing service providers, it is necessary to supervise the demands of customers so that they could carry out reasonable dispatches. To achieve it, a number of data mining methods have been applied. But most of these predicting methods only consider this problem from the temporal aspect, neglecting the connection inter and intra blocks of the city. Blocks are the outputs of region partition, which divides the whole city into a series of divisions. At the same time, the partitioned map, specifying borders of blocks, is useful for platforms to improve the process of supervising, dispatching, and recommending. However, the majority of current partition methods is static and cannot effectively utilize features extracted from historical and geographical operational data. In this work, we propose to conduct partition task with taking distinct situations in different blocks into consideration. In particular, we propose a novel region partition assisted long short term memory neural network for ride-hailing service demand prediction. This is a two-phase model, consisting of the grid-merging region partition and the application of artificial neural network. In experiment part, we show how the region partition method assists LSTM to better forecast the demands, and compare it with other partition techniques. Finally, for evaluating the performance of RPA-LSTM, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset provided by Didi Chuxing. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the accuracy of prediction.},

	doi = {10.1186/s40537-022-00637-9},
	abstract = {Traffic flow prediction is an important part of an intelligent transportation system to alleviate congestion. In practice, most small and medium-sized activities are not given priority in transport planning, yet these activities often bring about a surge in demand for public transport. It is recognized that such patterns are inevitably more difficult to predict than those associated with day-to-day mobility, and that forecasting models built using traffic data alone are not comprehensive enough. Aiming at this problem, a depthwise separable convolutional fusion forecast network (FFN) was proposed by focusing on the impact of event information on traffic flow demand. FFN fused heterogeneous data to model traffic data, weather information, and event information extracted from the Internet. The depthwise separable one-dimensional convolution was used to encode the textual information describing the event layer by layer, and local one-dimensional sequence segments (ie subsequences) were extracted from the sequence to retain rich local semantic features. In the modeling process, the interaction of heterogeneous data was established, that is, the temporal and other data were used to drive the textual information representation in the encoding process to capture better relevant textual representations. Finally, information from different sources and formats was fused to obtain a joint feature representation tensor that predicts the traffic demand in the next day's event area. The experimental results show that the average absolute error of the fusion prediction network is reduced by 26.5\%, the root mean square error is reduced by 11.6\%, and the judgment coefficient is increased by 26.4\% compared with the prediction network that only considers the traffic data.},

In this paper, we propose a sequence learning model that can predict future taxi requests in each area of a city based on the recent demand and other relevant information. Remembering information from the past is critical here, since taxi requests in the future are correlated with information about actions that happened in the past. For example, someone who requests a taxi to a shopping center, may also request a taxi to return home after few hours. We use one of the best sequence learning methods, long short term memory that has a gating mechanism to store the relevant information for future use. We evaluate our method on a data set of taxi requests in New York City by dividing the city into small areas and predicting the demand in each area. We show that this approach outperforms other prediction methods, such as feed-forward neural networks. In addition, we show how adding other relevant information, such as weather, time, and drop-offs affects the results.},

However, most of the previous methods only considered the taxi demand prediction in origin regions, while ignoring the modeling of the specific situation of the destination passengers. In this paper, we present a more challenging task, called taxi origin-destination demand prediction, which aims at predicting the taxi demand between all origin-destination (OD) pairs in a future time interval. Its main challenges lie in how to effectively capture the diverse contextual information to learn the demand patterns. We address this problem with a novel Contextualized Spatial-Temporal Network (CSTN), which can effectively capture various context of taxi demand into a unified framework. Specifically, the proposed network consists of three components for the modeling of local spatial context (LSC), temporal evolution context (TEC) and global correlation context (GCC) respectively. Extensive experiments and evaluations on a large-scale dataset well demonstrate the significant superiority of our CSTN over other compared methods of taxi origin-destination demand prediction.},

The results of an offline experiment conducted herein indicate that when real-time population data were used, the root mean squared prediction error of the proposed algorithm was 1.370 as opposed to 1.513 when population data were not used. In addition, we conducted a field test. We implement a real-time prediction system based on real-time population data, the first such online real-world test conducted worldwide. In the trial, 26 participant drivers tried our demand forecast system.

	abstract = {Taxi passenger demand prediction is of great significance to perceive citywide human mobility and make a lot of urban sensing applications more convenient. There are two major challenges to develop accurate predictive models, i.e., the complexity of the spatial-temporal dependencies as well as the dynamicity caused by some unpredictable dependencies. Although existing work uses various methods such as time series analysis, machine learning, and deep learning, most of them ignore two facts: the uncertainty of taxi demands and the impact of the parallel car-hailing markets (e.g., Uber demands) on taxi demands. In this paper, in order to deal with these two facts systematically, we design a unified framework that can use multi-source data to improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we analyze the correlations between taxi and Uber demands and design two deep models, each of which containing a specific feature fusion method. The first model adaptively aggregates features of each grid according to the correlations. To realize the feature fusion among adjacent grids, the other method contains an additional local convolution. Besides, we also study the impact of Uber demand trends on taxi demands and aggregate the impact into the second model to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluate our models based on both taxi and Uber datasets collected from New York City, USA. Results show that our models achieve superior performance compared to the state of the art.},

The gap between demand and the actual amount for taxi causes trouble for travelers. Forecasts for taxi demand do not take into account the possible interactions of taxi demand between areas, which can lead to a decrease in the accuracy of the forecast. In further exploiting the interaction of taxi demand in each area, We propose An extended Maximum Correlation Regressor Chain method (MCRC) and a new MCRC-based Dynamically Adjusted Regressor Chain method. MCRC uses the various relationships existing among the targets, which are evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, feature importance matrix, and maximal information coefficient, respectively, to form the maximum correlation chain with higher prediction accuracy. Based on MCRC, DARC dynamically adjusts the base-regressor of the regressor chain. A set of predictive approaches are implemented to compare the performances, and the results show that the maximal information coefficient DARC (DARC\_MIC) achieves the best accurate rate by 91.80\%. DARC\_MIC is not only can provide managers a more rational taxi operation approach but also more proper for dealing with multi-target regression problems with Lots of targets. This idea of first measuring the degree of interaction between targets and then combining algorithms to further exploit this degree of interaction between targets can also be attempted to improve many other multi-target regression algorithms.},

	abstract = {In transportation, nature, economy, environment, and many other settings, there are multiple simultaneous phenomena happening that are of interest to model and predict. Over the last few years, the traffic data that we have at our disposal have significantly increased, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Most existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly focus on capturing recurrent mobility trends that relate to habitual/routine behaviour, and on exploiting short-term correlations with recent observation patterns. However, valuable information that is often available in the form of unstructured data is neglected when attempting to improve forecasting results. In this paper, we explore time-series data and textual information combinations using machine learning techniques in the context of creating a prediction model that is able to capture in real-time future stressful situations of the studied transportation system. Using publicly available taxi data from New York, we empirically show that the proposed models are able to significantly reduce the error in the forecasts. The final mean absolute error (MAE) of our predictions is decreased by 19.5\% for a three months testing period and by 57\% if we focus only on event periods.},

	abstract = {Intelligent transport support systems have had a major impact on people's urban mobility. In large urban centers, transportation services still need ways to optimize vehicle supply in certain areas, according to the demand in each of them. Optimized distribution of on-demand taxi services can be part of an intelligent urban mobility plan, causing direct impacts on urban traffic, improving transport accessibility, improving safety at taxi standpoints by reduced waiting times, reduce transportation fare etc. Many vehicle-mounted sensors currently generate real-time information that is not used for processing and generating information with value. This paper proposes a Taxi Demand Forecasting methodology using stream machine learning algorithms that tackle concept drift detection on taxi data stream. A real data source made available on the New York open platform feeds a stream learning model, constructed using the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) tool - a framework for data stream mining. The stream model shows promising results in forecasting taxi demand, reaching 78\% accuracy. Despite using data from a specific city, the methodology and results of this work can contribute to a more proactive demand management in other cities.},

This framework is based on a deep-learning structure with residual connections in the LSTM layers and the attention mechanism. We found that adding residuals accelerates optimization and that adding the attention mechanism makes the model better predict the taxi demands, especially when the demand fluctuates greatly in the peak hours and off-peak hours. We conducted extensive experiments by comparing the proposed models to the time-series model (ARIMA), traditional supervised learning model (ridge regression), strong machine learning model that won many Kaggle competitions (Gradient Boosted Decision Tree implemented in the XGBoost library), and deep learning models (LSTM and DMVST-Net) on two real and open-source datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed models outperform the baselines for most cases. We believe the greatest improvement comes from the attention mechanism, which helps distinguish the demands in the peak hours and off-peak hours. Additionally, the proposed model runs 10\% to 40\%-times faster than the other deep-learning-based models. We applied the models to participate in a taxi demand prediction challenge and won second place out of hundreds of teams.},

	abstract = {Road traffic pollution is one of the key factors affecting urban air quality. There is a consensus in the community that the efficient use of public transport is the most effective solution. In that sense, much effort has been made in the data mining discipline to come up with solutions able to anticipate taxi demands in a city. This helps to optimize the trips made by such an important urban means of transport. However, most of the existing solutions in the literature define the taxi demand prediction as a regression problem based on historical taxi records. This causes serious limitations with respect to the required data to operate and the interpretability of the prediction outcome. In this paper, we introduce QUADRIVEN (QUalitative tAxi Demand pRediction based on tIme-Variant onlinE social Network data analysis), a novel approach to deal with the taxi demand prediction problem based on human-generated data widely available on online social networks. The result of the prediction is defined on the basis of categorical labels that allow obtaining a semantically-enriched output. Finally, this proposal was tested with different models in a large urban area, showing quite promising results with an F1 score above 0.8.},

	abstract = {Taxi demand prediction is an important building block to enabling intelligent transportation systems in a smart city. An accurate prediction model can help the city pre-allocate resources to meet travel demand and to reduce empty taxis on streets which waste energy and worsen the traffic congestion. With the increasing popularity of taxi requesting services such as Uber and Didi Chuxing (in China), we are able to collect large-scale taxi demand data continuously. How to utilize such big data to improve the demand prediction is an interesting and critical real-world problem. Traditional demand prediction methods mostly rely on time series forecasting techniques, which fail to model the complex non-linear spatial and temporal relations. Recent advances in deep learning have shown superior performance on traditionally challenging tasks such as image classification by learning the complex features and correlations from large-scale data. This breakthrough has inspired researchers to explore deep learning techniques on traffic prediction problems. However, existing methods on traffic prediction have only considered spatial relation (e.g., using CNN) or temporal relation (e.g., using LSTM) independently. We propose a Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network (DMVST-Net) framework to model both spatial and temporal relations. Specifically, our proposed model consists of three views: temporal view (modeling correlations between future demand values with near time points via LSTM), spatial view (modeling local spatial correlation via local CNN), and semantic view (modeling correlations among regions sharing similar temporal patterns). Experiments on large-scale real taxi demand data demonstrate effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.},

To make full use of the global and local correlations between traffic flows on road sections, this paper presents a deep learning model based on a graph convolutional network, long short-term memory (LSTM), and multitask learning. First, an undirected graph model was formed by considering the spatial pattern distribution of taxi trips on road networks. Then, LSTMs were used to extract the temporal features of traffic flows. Finally, the model was trained using a multitask learning strategy to improve the model's generalizability. In the experiments, the efficiency and accuracy were verified with real-world taxi trajectory data.

Finally, the importance of indicators was analyzed, and the essential elements were the time, temperature, and weather factors. The results indicate that the prediction effect of CFM is better than those of RFM and RRM.

Many efforts have been paid to provide accurate taxi demand prediction, and deep neural networks are leveraged recently. However, existing works are limited in properly incorporating multi-view taxi demand predictions together, by simply assigning fixed weights learned by training to the predictions of each region. To solve this problem, we apply the attention mechanism for leveraging contextual information to assist prediction, and a context-aware attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network (CACRNN) is proposed. Specially, we forecast fine-grained taxi demands with considering multi-view features, including spatial correlations among adjacent regions, short-term periodicity, long-term periodicity, and impacts of external factors. Local convolutional (LC) layers and gated recurrent units (GRUs) are utilized to extract the features from historical records. Moreover, a context-aware attention module is employed to incorporate the predictions of each region with considering different features, which is our novel attempt. This module assigns different weights to the predictions of a region according to its contextual information such as weather, index of time slots, and region function. We conduct comprehensive experiments based on a large-scale real-world dataset from New York City, and the results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

Even, there are some works proposed to predict the demand of taxi but there are few studies that consider the function of areas such as hospital area, department store area, residential area, and tourist attraction. One predictive model may not fit with all types of area. We use a point of interest (POI) to match taxi demand with a place to study the taxi demand in the area with a different function. In this paper, we investigate the best predictive models that can forecast demand of taxi hourly with 7 types of area function. The models that were selected for the experiment are long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST). Then, we proposed the ensemble model that can forecast the taxi demand well with all types of area function using the information from those machine learning models. We build the models based on a real-world dataset generated by over 5,000 taxis in Bangkok, Thailand for 4 months.

The origin and the destination of entertainment scene are more unsure than that of commuting scene, so both origin and destination should be predicted.

Accurate taxi demand prediction can bring various advantages including, but not limited to, enhancing user experience, increasing taxi utilization, and optimizing traffic efficiency. However, the task is challenging because of complex spatial and temporal dependencies of taxi demand. In addition, relationships between non-adjacent regions are also critical for accurate taxi demand prediction, whereas they are largely ignored by existing approaches. To this end, we propose a novel graph and time-series learning model for city-wide taxi demand prediction in this paper. It has two main building blocks, the first one utilize a graph network with attention mechanism to effectively learn spatial dependencies of taxi demand in a broader perspective of the entire city, and the output at each time interval is then transferred to the second block. In the graph network, the edge is defined by an Origin-Destination relation to capture non-adjacent impacts. The second one uses a neural network which is adept with processing sequence data to capture the temporal correlations of city-wide taxi demand. Using a large, real-world dataset and three metrics, we conduct an extensive experimental study and find that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 9.3\% in terms of the root-mean-square error.},

This is due to the increasingly popular real-time ride sharing, which is an economical and environment-friendly way to call taxis. Such refined taxi demand prediction would improve service quality and user experience. In this paper, we propose a method named ST-Vec, which maps zones with dense low-dimensional vectors (embedding) sustaining their spatio-temporal relationships of taxi demand, i.e. the more probable destination zones of taxi demand from a given zones, their vectors would be closer. By such method, the spatio-temporal relationships of taxi demand in zones can be measured in terms of geometric distance between the respective vectors. By combining this with multi-outputs support vector regression (MSVR) model, we obtain a robust refined taxi demand prediction model and verify it on the New York City taxi trip dataset.},

In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria route recommendation framework that considers real-time spatial-temporal predictions and traffic network information, aiming to optimize a taxi driver’s profit when the driver has an advance reservation. Our framework consists of four components. First, we build a grid-based road network graph for modeling traffic network information during the search routes process. Next, we conduct two prediction modules that adopt advanced deep learning techniques to guide a proper search direction in the final planning stage. One module, taxi demand prediction, is used to estimate the pick-up probabilities of passengers in the city. Another one is destination prediction, which can predict the distribution of drop-off probabilities and capture the flow of potential passengers. Finally, we propose our J* (J-star) algorithm, which jointly considers pick-up probabilities, drop-off distribution, road network, distance, and time factors based on the attentive heuristic function. Compared with existing route planning methods, the experimental results on a real-world dataset (NYC taxi datasets) have shown our proposed approach is more effective and robust. Moreover, our designed search scheme in J* can decrease the computing time and make the search process more efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on designing a guiding route, which can increase the income of taxi drivers when they have an advance reservation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

However, accurate taxi demand prediction is still a challenge, because it needs to decouple complex time and space dependence as much as possible. Recently, the research on spatial-temporal dependence capturing in transportation field tends to adopt the method of combining graph neural network and time series models. However, these models expose some shortcomings, including the overlook of long-range temporal dependencies and dynamic spatial dependence. This paper presents an innovative graph model that is integrated with contextualized spatial-temporal information to improve taxi demand prediction.

The taxi-scheduling system is decomposed into two fundamental components: routing with known requests and routing with unknown requests. In the online scenario, one of the critical components of the taxi-scheduling system is the scheduling system with unknown requests, which aims to suggest more efficient routes for drivers. Therefore, this paper focuses on the taxi-scheduling problem based on predictive information in online scenarios. We propose a novel scheduling algorithm based on the predicted spatio-temporal information that attempts to exploit prediction information to recommend profitable driving routes to taxi drivers as well as to reduce the idling travel distance. We experiment on real taxi data sets. The predictive information is input data and generated by a simple probabilistic network model. The results show that our method is able to save from 9.64\% to 12.76\% total idling travel distance compared with previous works. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

However, due to the complex structure of urban road network, taxi flow is difficult to be accurately predicted.

	abstract = {In the context of the carbon neutrality target, carbon reduction in the daily operation of the transportation system is more important than that in productive activities. There are few travel services that can quantify low-carbon travel, with a lack of effective low-carbon travel tools to guide transportation behavior. On-demand access to taxi services can effectively reduce the additional carbon emissions caused by cruising, which in turn increases efficiency in urban mobility with a reduced taxi fleet scale. For individual taxis, they lack macroscopic horizon in their choice of passenger pickup paths. The selected travel path based on personal operational experience or real-time location is limited by local optimization when making path decisions. In this work, we proposed a macro-path recommendation method to assist the taxi pickup path selection to accelerate the transformation of the taxi system towards low-carbon sharing. First, an adaptive learning spatiotemporal neural network was used to predict the coarse-grained distribution of potential trips. Next, the trajectory sharing graph was constructed based on the potential trips distribution to reallocate the taxi orders for the continuous pickup path optimization. As a result, the continuous pickup path balanced the relation between travel demands and taxi supply, improving the economic and environmental benefits of taxi operation and contributing to the goal of carbon neutrality. We conducted experiments on the Chengdu city ride-hailing dataset. Compared with the current status of taxi operations, the solution shows improvements in both the scale of taxi services and order gain. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The key component of DeepTransport is based on the deep learning architecture that that aims to understand human mobility and transportation patterns from big and heterogeneous data. Based on the learning model, given any time period, speciﬁc location of the city or people’s observed movements, our system can automatically simulate or predict the persons’ future movements and their transportation mode in the large-scale transportation network.

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

We test the end-to-end performance of this controller with a state-of-the-art LSTM neural network to predict customer demand and real customer data from DiDi Chuxing: we show that this approach scales very well for large systems (indeed, the computational complexity of the MPC algorithm does not depend on the number of customers and of vehicles in the system) and outperforms state-of-the-art rebalancing strategies by reducing the mean customer wait time by up to to 89.6\%.},

Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of N times, where N is the number of layers.

	abstract = {Charging infrastructure is the coupling link between power and transportation networks, thus determining charging station siting is necessary for planning of power and transportation systems. While previous works have either optimized for charging station siting given historic travel behavior, or optimized ﬂeet routing and charging given an assumed placement of the stations, this paper introduces a linear program that optimizes for station siting and macroscopic ﬂeet operations in a joint fashion. Given an electricity retail rate and a set of travel demand requests, the optimization minimizes total cost for an autonomous EV ﬂeet comprising of travel costs, station procurement costs, ﬂeet procurement costs, and electricity costs, including demand charges. Speciﬁcally, the optimization returns the number of charging plugs for each charging rate (e.g., Level 2, DC fast charging) at each candidate location, as well as the optimal routing and charging of the ﬂeet. From a case-study of an electric vehicle ﬂeet operating in San Francisco, our results show that, albeit with range limitations, small EVs with low procurement costs and high energy efﬁciencies are the most cost-effective in terms of total ownership costs. Furthermore, the optimal siting of charging stations is more spatially distributed than the current siting of stations, consisting mainly of high-power Level 2 AC stations (16.8 kW) with a small share of DC fast charging stations and no standard 7.7kW Level 2 stations. Optimal siting reduces the total costs, empty vehicle travel, and peak charging load by up to 10\%.},

	abstract = {Shared micromobility systems are rapidly pervading urban environments. Usually, they are either dockless, in line with free-floating paradigms whereby vehicles can be left and picked up anywhere within the region of operation, or have docking stations with predefined parking slots. In this paper, we present an optimization-based framework to analyze and compare the advantages and disadvantages of these two different types of micromobility systems. We also include the possibility of rebalancing the system by the operator. First, we leverage graph theory to build a linear time-invariant network flow model of the two systems and use it to frame the time-optimal routing problem. Specifically, we formulate a linear program (LP) for the dockless system and a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for the docked one whereby we jointly optimize the siting of the docking stations. Given their structure, both problems can be solved with off-the-shelf algorithms and global optimality guarantees. Second, we showcase our framework with a case study of Manhattan, NYC, whereby we quantitatively compare the performance achievable by the two micromobility paradigms. Our simulations suggest that increasing the number of stations of docked micromobility systems may decrease the average travel time up to a minimum aligned with the travel time achievable by dockless systems. Thereby, adding more stations does not significantly improve the system’s performance. Moreover, due to the slightly asymmetric travel demands, a mild rebalance of the system is enough to boost its performance.},

	abstract = {Multivariate time series forecasting has long been a research hotspot because of its wide range of application scenarios. However, the dynamics and multiple patterns of spatiotemporal dependencies make this problem challenging. Most existing methods suffer from two major shortcomings: (1) They ignore the local context semantics when modeling temporal dependencies. (2) They lack the ability to capture the spatial dependencies of multiple patterns. To tackle such issues, we propose a novel Transformer-based model for multivariate time series forecasting, called the spatial–temporal convolutional Transformer network (STCTN). STCTN mainly consists of two novel attention mechanisms to respectively model temporal and spatial dependencies. Local-range convolutional attention mechanism is proposed in STCTN to simultaneously focus on both global and local context temporal dependencies at the sequence level, which addresses the ﬁrst shortcoming. Group-range convolutional attention mechanism is designed to model multiple spatial dependency patterns at graph level, as well as reduce the computation and memory complexity, which addresses the second shortcoming. Continuous positional encoding is proposed to link the historical observations and predicted future values in positional encoding, which also improves the forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that the proposed STCTN outperforms the start-of-the-art methods and is more robust to nonsmooth time series data.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

It is essential for the interest of the commuters and the taxi companies both to have an accurate measure of taxi demands at different regions of a city and at varying time intervals. This reduces the cost of resources, efforts and meets the customers’ satisfaction at its best. Modern predictive models have shown the potency of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in this domain over any traditional, statistical, or Tensor-Based predictive models in terms of accuracy. The recent DNN models using leading technologies like Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Graph Convolution Networks (GCN), ConvLSTM, etc. are not able to efficiently capture the existing spatio-temporal characteristics in taxi demand time-series. The feature aggregation techniques in these models lack channeling and uniqueness causing less distinctive but overlapping feature space which results in a compromised prediction performance having high error propagation possibility. The present work introduces Spatio-Temporal Aggregator Predictor (ST-AGP), a DNN model which aggregates spatio-temporal features into (1) non-redundant and (2) highly distinctive feature space and in turn helps (3) reduce noise propagation for a high performing multi-step predictive model. The proposed model integrates the effective feature engineering techniques of machine learning approach with the non-linear capability of a DNN model. Consequently, the proposed model is able to use only the informative features responsible for the objective task with reduce noise propagation. Unlike, existing DNN models, ST-AGP is able to induce these qualities of feature aggregation without the use of Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approach or any additional supervised attention that existing models need for their notable performance. A considerable high-performance gain of 25 − 37\% on two real-world city taxi datasets by ST-AGP over the state-of-art models on standard benchmark metrics establishes the efficacy of the proposed model over the existing ones. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

It helps to properly allocate vehicles, ease the traffic pressure and improve passengers’ experience. Traditional taxi demand prediction methods mostly rely on time-series forecasting techniques, which cannot model the nonlinearity embedded in data. Recent studies start to combine the Euclidean spatial features through grid-based methods. By considering the spatial correlations among different regions, we can capture how the temporal events have impacts on those with adjacent links or intersections and improve prediction precision. Some graph-based models are proposed to encode the non-Euclidean correlations as well. However, the temporal periodicity of data is often overlooked, and the study units are usually constructed as oversimplified grids. In this paper, we define places with specific semantic and humanistic experiences as study units, using a fuzzy set method based on adaptive kernel density estimation. Then, we introduce dual temporal gated multi-graph convolution network to predict the future taxi demand. Specifically, multi-graph convolution is used to model spatial correlations with graphs, including the neighborhood, functional similarities and landscape similarities based on street view images. As for the temporal dependencies modeling, we design the dual temporal gated branches to capture information hidden in both previous and periodic observations. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our model over the baselines. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {With traffic network becoming increasingly complicated, traffic flow prediction has important practical significance for the management of traffic roads and public safety. For example, an accurate taxi demand prediction can help to improve efficiency of vehicle scheduling and reduce traffic congestion. The main issue of flow prediction is how to extract the information of complex spatio-temporal dependencies and interactions between arrival and departure. To solve these problems, we develop a deep learning method based on time-dependent attention convolutional LSTM (TDAConvLSTM) in which a time-dependent attention mechanism is designed to learn similarities of historical traffic flows among different time intervals and a fusion mechanism is introduced to aggregate the feature information produced by convolutional LSTM and attention module. And then, the result of the feature aggregation is fed to a multi-layer deconvolutional network to gain the results of flow prediction. Experimental studies on two real-life datasets indicate that TDAConvLSTM achieves better results than the compared models.

This task is challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal correlations and semantic trends between different locations. Existing work tried to solve this problem by exploiting a variety of spatiotemporal models based on deep learning. However, we observe that more semantic pair-wise correlations among possibly distant roads are also critical for taxi demand prediction. To combine the spatiotemporal correlations with semantic correlations in the traffic network, this paper proposed an end-to-end framework called DeepTDP. First, we defined five kinds of spatial and semantic correlations, which are modeled into multi location graphs and fused by multi-graph convolutional network. Second, LSTM in encoder-decoder network is utilized to capture temporal correlation between future taxi demand values. Besides, a cross-entropy loss function based on error correction is designed to generate taxi demand predictions. Third, we apply a word embedding technique to reduce the dimension of decoded vector in output layer. Finally, we evaluate DeepTDP on two real world traffic datasets, the experiment results demonstrate effectiveness of our approach in comparison with variants of self and other baselines.},

	abstract = {Signal measurements appearing in the form of time series are one of the most common types of data used in medical machine learning applications. However, such datasets are often small, making the training of deep neural network architectures ineffective. For time-series, the suite of data augmentation tricks we can use to expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need to maintain the basic properties of the signal. Data generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can be utilized as another data augmentation tool. RNN-based GANs suffer from the fact that they cannot effectively model long sequences of data points with irregular temporal relations. To tackle these problems, we introduce TTS-GAN, a transformer-based GAN which can successfully generate realistic synthetic time-series data sequences of arbitrary length, similar to the real ones. Both the generator and discriminator networks of the GAN model are built using a pure transformer encoder architecture. We use visualizations and dimensionality reduction techniques to demonstrate the similarity of real and generated time-series data. We also compare the quality of our generated data with the best existing alternative, which is an RNN-based time-series GAN.},

An accurate prediction over such data is an important building block for several urban applications, such as taxi demand prediction, traffic flow prediction, and so on. Existing deep learning based approaches assume that outcome is deterministic and there is only one plausible future; therefore, cannot capture the multimodal nature of future contents and dynamics. In addition, existing approaches learn spatial and temporal data separately as they assume weak correlation between them. To handle these issues, in this article, we propose a stochastic spatio-temporal generative model (named D-GAN) which adopts Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based structure for more accurate ST prediction in multiple time steps. D-GAN consists of two components: (1) spatio-temporal correlation network which models spatio-temporal joint distribution of pixels and supports a stochastic sampling of latent variables for multiple plausible futures; (2) a stochastic adversarial network to jointly learn generation and variational inference of data through implicit distribution modeling. D-GAN also supports fusion of external factors through explicit objective to improve the model learning. Extensive experiments performed on two real-world datasets show that D-GAN achieves significant improvements and outperforms baseline models. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Taxi demand prediction plays a significant role in assisting the pre-allocation of taxi resources to avoid mismatches between demand and service, particularly in the era of the sharing economy and autonomous driving. However, most studies have only tried to figure out the complex spatial-temporal pattern of taxi demand from historical taxi demand series, neglecting the intrinsic influences of regional functions, and failing to effectively capture the dynamic long-term periodicity. In this paper, we make two important observations: (1) taxi demand pattern varies significantly between different functional regions; and (2) taxi demand follows a dynamic daily and weekly pattern. To address these two issues, we adopt Points of Interest (POIs) to identify regional functions, and propose a novel BERT-based Deep Spatial-Temporal Network (BDSTN) to model the complex spatial-temporal relations from heterogeneous local and global features. In BDSTN, a Spatiotemporal Pattern Matching module is introduced to capture the complex spatiotemporal pattern of taxi demand while considering its dynamic temporal periodicity, and a Functional Similarity Embedding module is adopted to learn the functional similarity among all regions via POIs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use BERT-based architecture to learn taxi demand patterns, and is also the first to take functional similarity represented by POIs into consideration. Our experimental results on real-world traffic datasets in New York City demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and that the efficiency of our proposed model is higher than other deep learning methods.},

The review begins with an attempt to classify and tabulate the research according to the properties of proposed models, their objectives and application areas in industry in different stages of the planning cycle. This is followed by an assessment of forecast methodologies with suggestions on different methodologies that industry practitioners can adopt to suit their specific needs and recommendations towards future directions of research. We also provide a look into the cross cutting concerns that need to be addressed by all forecasting systems irrespective of the domain or planning stage, such as demand unconstraining, aggregation and the role of expert judgement to incorporate the effect of other extraneous factors that might affect the demand. We conclude from our study that there is a lack of standardization in the way in which methods are described and tested. As a result, there is a lack of cumulative knowledge building. To redress this concern, we propose open source testbeds to facilitate benchmarking of new models. We also propose a checklist as a guideline to standardize the research reports and suggest that when proposing newer models, researchers may consider including a comparative study with existing standard models in research report.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, urban mobility plays an important role in modern cities for city planning, navigation, and other mobility services. Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).},

	abstract = {Predicting traffic demand is a crucial problem to saving energy and resource pre-allocation as well as traffic construction planning. The problem is also challenging owing to its non-linear changing process and complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Most existing studies train prediction models on traffic data itself and ignore the impact of exogenous factors, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. To address this issue, we propose a deep neural network, which utilizes multisource urban data to capture specific geospatial and temporal dependencies, for city-scale taxi demand forecasting. In terms of time dependency, a temporal guidance block is developed to enhance the correlation between time intervals by incorporating time metadata. To capture the geospatial dependencies, we build three parallel geospatial guidance branches that integrate multiple urban data, including population data, POIs, and road networks, to guide the modeling. Each branch contains a geocontext-aware convolutional layer for extracting geospatial features and a self-attention mechanism for capturing long-range spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our model over the existing methods, and the prediction error is 16\% lower than the state-of-the-art model. We also explore the sensitivity to its parameters and discuss the contributions and limitations of the proposed method. © 2022 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Accurate taxi demand forecasting may provide several benefits, including economic and traffic flow optimization. However, due to complicated spatial–temporal connections and irregular distant locations, predicting taxi demand becomes difficult. To address these issues, we proposed a novel architecture of multi-module spatial–temporal networks to collectively predict city-wide OD taxi demand. In our work to deal with adjacent areas in a city, we employed the 3D convolutional neural networks to extract the spatial–temporal dependencies and learn the OD taxi demand pattern. To handle remote areas, we created an attention-based auto encoder-decoder, in which the input of the set of convolutional layers creates a feature matrix. The feature matrix embeds the spatial–temporal correlation jointly and passing through the encoder layer. We encode the spatial–temporal features with the help of pooling layer, then flatten layer used the back-propagation method to decode the weight matrix. We apply the normalization function to determine the demand pattern influences. The influence vector we compute with the Euclidean distance formula to determine the similarity of all distant regions. Finally, we use the attention mechanism to calculate the attention weight score for each region that its neighbour impacted. Then we used long short-term memory, we captured the significant relationship of spatial–temporal dependencies with external factors. We train our model simultaneously to forecast city-wide taxi services OD.

Our framework consists of four components. First, we build a grid-based road network graph for modelling traffic network information during the search process. Next, we conduct two prediction modules that adopt advanced deep learning techniques to guide proper search directions in the final planning stage. One module, taxi demand prediction, is used to estimate the pick-up probabilities of passengers in the city. Another one is destination prediction, which can predict the distribution of drop-off probabilities and capture the flow of potential passengers. Finally, we propose J* (J-star) algorithm, which jointly considers pick-up probabilities, drop-off distribution, road network, distance, and time factors based on the attentive heuristic function. Compared with existing route planning methods, the experimental results on a real-world dataset have shown our proposed approach is more effective and robust. Moreover, our designed search scheme in J* can decrease the computing time and make the search process more efficient.

As a result, the algorithm was able to accurately obtain the distribution of taxi passengers' boarding positions compared to the actual taxi riding pattern through statistical analysis.

Traffic congestion and environmental concerns can be alleviated by sharing mobility, which reduces the number of vehicles on the road network. The taxi-parcel sharing problem has been considered as an efficient planning model for people and goods flows. In this paper, we enhance the functionality of a current people-parcel taxi sharing model. The adapted model analyzes the historical request data and predicts the current service demands. We then propose two novel online routing algorithms that construct optimal routes in real-time. The objectives are to maximize (as far as possible) both the parcel delivery requests and ride requests while minimizing the idle time and travel distance of the taxis. The proposed online routing algorithms are evaluated on instances adapted from real Cabspotting datasets. After implementing our routing algorithms, the total idle travel distance per day was 9.64\% to 12.76\% lower than that of the existing taxi-parcel sharing method. Our online routing algorithms can be incorporated into an efficient smart shared taxi system. 1225-6463/\$ © 2022 ETRI.},

An accurate short-term taxi demand prediction model in both spatial and temporal relations can assist a city pre-allocate its resources and facilitate city-scale taxi operation management in a megacity. To address problems similar to the above, in this study, we proposed a multi-zone order demand prediction model to predict short-term taxi order demand in different zones at city-scale. A two-step methodology was developed, including order zone division and multi-zone order prediction. For the zone division step, the K-means++ spatial clustering algorithm was used, and its parameter k was estimated by the between–within proportion index. For the prediction step, six methods (backpropagation neural network, support vector regression, random forest, average fusion-based method, weighted fusion-based method, and k-nearest neighbour fusion-based method) were used for comparison. To demonstrate the performance, three multi-zone weighted accuracy indictors were proposed to evaluate the order prediction ability at city-scale. These models were implemented and validated on real-world taxi order demand data from a three-month consecutive collection in Shenzhen, China. Experiment on the city-scale taxi demand data demonstrated the superior prediction performance of the multi-zone order demand prediction model with the k-nearest neighbour fusion-based method based on the proposed accuracy indicator. © 2021 Li et al.

To this end, this paper explores zone clustering and how to utilize the inter-zone heterogeneity to improve the prediction. First, based on the pairwise clustering theory, a taxi zone clustering algorithm is designed by considering the correlations among different taxi zones. Then, both the cluster-level and the global-level prediction modules are developed to extract intra- and inter-cluster characteristics, respectively. Finally, a Multi-Level Recurrent Neural Networks (MLRNN) model is proposed by combining the two modules.

However, these methods overlook the existence of hyper-imbalanced taxi demand, which may result in good indicators in numerical experiments but weak performance in real scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the hyper-imbalance data and improve deep learning abilities for taxi demand prediction. To accomplish this task, slice indicators are introduced to fairly evaluate prediction performance at each taxi demand level. Then, through the lens of the slice indicators, a new form of loss called slice-weighted loss (SWL) is developed to improve the prediction of high taxi demand. Combining the SWL with an improved convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) model, a spatiotemporal network called slice-wighted-Conv-LSTM (SW-CLSTM) is proposed. It can overcome the problem of data hyper-imbalance and make considerable improvements in taxi demand prediction. By conducting extensive experiments on large-scale TLC trips, we validate the power of sliceindicators and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Urban dispersal events occur when an unexpectedly large number of people leave an area in a relatively short period of time. It is beneficial for the city authorities, such as law enforcement and city management, to have an advance knowledge of such events, as it can help them mitigate the safety risks and handle important challenges such as managing traffic, and so forth. Predicting dispersal events is also beneficial to Taxi drivers and/or ride-sharing services, as it will help them respond to an unexpected demand and gain competitive advantage. Large urban datasets such as detailed trip records and point of interest (POI) data make such predictions achievable. The related literature mainly focused on taxi demand prediction. The pattern of the demand was assumed to be repetitive and proposed methods aimed at capturing those patterns. However, dispersal events are, by definition, violations of those patterns and are, understandably, missed by the methods in the literature. We proposed a different approach in our prior work [32]. We showed that dispersal events can be predicted by learning the complex patterns of arrival and other features that precede them in time. We proposed a survival analysis formulation of this problem and proposed a two-stage framework (DILSA), where a deep learning model predicted the survival function at each point in time in the future. We used that prediction to determine the time of the dispersal event in the future, or its non-occurrence. However, DILSA is subject to a few limitations. First, based on evidence from the data, mobility patterns can vary through time at a given location. DILSA does not distinguish between different mobility patterns through time. Second, mobility patterns are also different for different locations. DILSA does not have the capability to directly distinguish between different locations based on their mobility patterns. In this article, we address these limitations by proposing a method to capture the interaction between POIs and mobility patterns and we create vector representations of locations based on their mobility patterns. We call our new method DILSA+. We conduct extensive case studies and experiments on the NYC Yellow taxi dataset from 2014 to 2016. Results show that DILSA+ can predict events in the next 5 hours with an F1-score of 0.66. It is significantly better than DILSA and the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for taxi demand prediction. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Taxi demand prediction has recently attracted increasing research interest due to its huge potential application in large-scale intelligent transportation systems. However, most of the previous methods only considered the taxi demand prediction in origin regions, but neglected the modeling of the specific situation of the destination passengers. We believe it is suboptimal to preallocate the taxi into each region-based solely on the taxi origin demand. In this paper, we present a challenging and worth-exploring task, called taxi origin-destination demand prediction, which aims at predicting the taxi demand between all-region pairs in a future time interval. Its main challenges come from how to effectively capture the diverse contextual information to learn the demand patterns. We address this problem with a novel contextualized spatial-temporal network (CSTN), which consists of three components for the modeling of local spatial context (LSC), temporal evolution context (TEC), and global correlation context (GCC), respectively. First, an LSC module utilizes two convolution neural networks to learn the local spatial dependencies of taxi, demand respectively, from the origin view and the destination view. Second, a TEC module incorporates the local spatial features of taxi demand and the meteorological information to a Convolutional Long Short-term Memory Network (ConvLSTM) for the analysis of taxi demand evolution. Finally, a GCC module is applied to model the correlation between all regions by computing a global correlation feature as a weighted sum of all regional features, with the weights being calculated as the similarity between the corresponding region pairs. The extensive experiments and evaluations on a large-scale dataset well demonstrate the superiority of our CSTN over other compared methods for the taxi origin-destination demand prediction.},

	abstract = {Proactive taxi dispatching is of great importance to balance taxi demand-supply gaps among different locations in a city. Recent advances primarily rely on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to directly learn the optimal dispatching policy. These works, however, are still not sufficiently efficient because they overlook several pieces of valuable context information. As a result, they may generate quite a few improper actions and introduce unnecessary coordination costs. To improve existing works, we present COX - a context-aware taxi dispatching approach that incorporates rich contexts into DRL modeling for more efficient taxi reallocations. Specifically, rather than simply dividing the service area into grids, COX proposes a road connectivity aware clustering algorithm to divide the road network graph into zones for practical taxi dispatching. In addition, COX comprehensively analyzes zone-level taxi demands and supplies through accurate taxi demand prediction and timely updates of taxi statuses. COX improves the DRL modeling by integrating these derived contexts, e.g., state representation with complete demand/supply data and sequential action generation with full coordination among idle taxis. In particular, we implement an environment simulator to train and evaluate COX using a large real-world taxi dataset. Extensive experiments show that COX outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various performance metrics, e.g., on average improving the total order values by 6.74\%, while reducing the number of unserved taxi orders and passengers' waiting time by 4.92\% and 44.84\%, respectively. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Predictive analytics stands for prediction of future demand with the help of historical data. An accurate prediction of future demand is the need for a competitive and challenging market. Thus a robust and accurate model is required to cater to such needs. This paper proposes two novel approaches for taxi demand prediction that is about to come in the next ten-minutes interval. The first model is a three-stage ensemble model for prediction where the first stage consists of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) and then Mini-Batch K-Means clustering is applied, followed by time-binning in the second stage and in the final stage the processed data is fed to the Ensemble Model. The second model is a four-stage deep learning model where the first two stages are common as the proposed ensemble model. In the third stage, the Fourier Transform of the time series data is used to extract and add more features to the training set and in the final stage, the processed training set is fed to the deep neural network (DNN) for prediction. The NYC TLC trip dataset is used for the experiments, and the results clearly indicate that the proposed models perform better than the existing models and the deep learning model performs the best among all.},

Despite the potential already demonstrated by deep learning methods in modeling spatiotemporal data, typical approaches tend to focus solely on conditional expectations of the output variables being modeled. In this article, we propose a multioutput multiquantile deep learning approach for jointly modeling several conditional quantiles together with the conditional expectation as a way to provide a more complete “picture” of the predictive density in spatiotemporal problems. Using two large-scale data sets from the transportation domain, we empirically demonstrate that, by approaching the quantile regression problem from a multitask learning perspective, it is possible to solve the embarrassing quantile crossings problem while simultaneously significantly outperforming state-of-the-art quantile regression methods. Moreover, we show that jointly modeling the mean and several conditional quantiles not only provides a rich description about the predictive density that can capture heteroscedastic properties at a neglectable computational overhead but also leads to improved predictions of the conditional expectation due to the extra information and the regularization effect induced by the added quantiles.},

	abstract = {The ubiquity of mobile devices use has generated huge volumes of location-aware contextual data, providing opportunities enriching various location-based social network (LBSN) applications - e.g., trip recommendation, ride-sharing allocation and taxi demand prediction etc. Trajectory-based social circle inference (TSCI), which aims at inferring the social relationships among users based on the human mobility data, has received great attention in recent years due to its importance in many LBSN applications. However, existing solutions suffer from three key challenges, including (1) lack of modeling contextual feature in user check-ins; (2) cannot capture the structural information in user motion patterns; (3) and fail to consider the underlying mobility distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ASCI-CAM (Adversity-based Social Circles Inference via Context-Aware Mobility) to address the above challenges. ASCI-CAM is a graph-based model taking into account the contextual information associated with check-ins which, combined with an attentive auto-encoder, allows for semantic trajectory representation. We regularize the learned trajectory embedding with an adversarial learning procedure, which allows us to better understand the user mobility patterns and personalized trajectory distribution. Our extensive experiments on real-world mobility datasets demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {With the development and progress of smart cities, ride-hailing have high passenger demand because of high spatial and temporal flexibility. However, when ride-hailing platforms dispatch vehicles, it finds that lots of vehicles wandering areas with no demand and areas with passenger demand have no service vehicles, resulting in increased vehicle costs, reduced benefits, and increased passenger waiting times. To solve this problem, it is necessary to accurately predict high demand areas to guide service vehicles to converge to these areas earlier, which helps to balance the demand and supply of the ride-sharing platform. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical clustering application algorithm based on distance and density (HDDCA) to construct virtual service areas, and a hybrid network based convolutional and time-series models is used for demand prediction. To improve the prediction accuracy, the correlation between virtual service areas is explored and used as the input of the prediction model to predict the demand for different virtual service areas in the next interval. In addition, the attention mechanism is also used to capture external factors with different weights. In this paper, experiments are conducted on the travel data set of Haikou City in 2017, and the results show that the prediction accuracy of this method is better than that of some typical models and existing deep neural network models, which validates the effectiveness.},

	abstract = {The prediction of taxi demand service has become a recently attractive area of research along with large-scale and potential applications in the intelligent transportation system. The demand process is divided into two main parts: Picking-up and dropping-off demand based on passenger habit. Taxi demand prediction is a great concept for drivers and passengers, and is designed platforms for ride-hailing and municipal managers. The majority of research has focused on forecasting the pickup part of demand service and specifying the interconnection of spatial and temporal correlations. In this study, the main focus is to overcome the access point of non-registered users for having fake transactions using taxi services and predicting taxi demand pick-up and drop-off information. The integration of machine learning techniques and blockchain framework is considered a possible solution for this problem. The blockchain technique was selected as an effective technique for protecting and controlling the real-time system. Historical data analysis was processed by extracting the three higher related sections for the intervening time, namely closeness and trend. Next, the pick-up and drop-off taxi prediction task was processed based on constructing the components of multi-task learning and spatiotemporal feature extraction. The combination of feature embedding performance and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) obtain the pick-up and drop-off correlation by fusing the historical data spatiotemporal features. Finally, the taxi demand pick-up and drop-off prediction were processed based on the combination of the external factors. The experimental result is based on a real dataset in Jeju Island, South Korea, to show the proposed system’s efficacy and performance compared with other state-of-art models. © 2021 by the authors.

In this article, we propose a path decision framework that considers real-time spatial-temporal predictions and traffic network information. The goal is to optimize a taxi driver's profit when considering a reservation. Our framework contains four components. First, we build a grid-based road network graph for modeling traffic network information for speeding up the search process. Next, we conduct two prediction modules that adopt advanced deep learning techniques to guide proper search directions for recommending cruising locations. One module of the taxi demand prediction is used to estimate the pick-up probabilities of passengers in the city. Another one is destination prediction, which can predict the distribution of drop-off probabilities and capture the flow of potential passengers. Finally, we propose the H∗ (Heuristic-star) algorithm, which jointly considers pick-up probabilities, drop-off distribution, road network, distance, and time factors based on the attentive heuristic function to dynamically recommend next cruising locations. Compared with existing route planning methods, the experimental results on a real-world dataset have shown that our proposed approach is more effective and robust. Moreover, our designed search scheme in H* can decrease the computing time and allow the search process to be more efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on guiding a route, which can increase the income of taxi drivers under the constraint of booking information. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.

Existing camera based approaches relies on hand crafted rules, image based classiﬁcation and supervised learning.

To tackle this problem, we propose to use a 3D convolutional autoencoder. It is inspired from the DeepFall paper where they use it for an unsupervised fall detection task. In this paper, we reproduce their results on the fall detection task and further extend this model to detect intrusions in a perimeter intrusion dataset. We also provide an extended evaluation scheme which helps to draw essential insights from the results. Our results1 show that we correctly reproduce the results of fall detection task and furthermore our model shows competitive performance in perimeter intrusion detection task.

We propose a Transformer-based autoregressive architecture, which is trained to sequentially predict the conditional distribution of the next element in such sequences, and which scales effectively to high resolution images. On a range of image datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can generate high quality, diverse images, with sample metric scores competitive with state of the art methods.

With a view to devising possible solutions to the congestion challenge, we characterize it using basic tools from the field of traffic management and engineering. This reveals that, as with many other problems, apparently common sense solutions do not work, and in particular that congestion cannot be solved by road infrastructure construction alone. In this context, we also discuss two paradoxes that reinforce the idea that “obvious” solutions do not work, and outline certain phenomena suggesting that the worst enemy of urban sustainability is the indiscriminate use of private cars in congested scenarios. We then argue that urban development and mobility are wicked problems in organized complexity and, as such, do not have completely satisfactory solutions. In this light we propose what we believe has become the most consensual solution among specialists: a stick and carrot approach. The stick is a policy such as road pricing that charges for using cars in urban areas during congested periods, while the carrot consists of a good public transport system. Finally, we caution that this approach is unlikely to be implemented unless there is a political champion who is prepared to lead longer-term strategies that can capture the enthusiasm of the citizenry.},

	abstract = {Rapid urban growth and rising mobility demand in megacities having a population of more than 10 million people in emerging economies call for a consistent and comprehensive urban mobility policy framework. Implementing sustainable urban mobility policies in these cities is complicated by fragmented governance structures, conflicting policy priorities and lack of effective financing mechanisms. The city of Istanbul, with a population of nearly 15 million people, has been grappling with rapidly increasing urban mobility problems such as chronic traffic congestion, increasing motorization, overcrowded public transport services, air and noise pollution. Although major infrastructure investments such as new metro and tram lines, a bus rapid transit (BRT) line and capacity increases in public bus network have been undertaken in recent years, the objective of achieving a modal shift from car use to more sustainable transport modes such as public transport, cycling and walking is far from being realized. The focus on megaprojects such as Marmaray, Eurasia Tunnel and Third Bridge further complicate the urban mobility landscape by bringing about conflicting policy priorities. In this paper, a comprehensive review and analysis of Istanbul’s urban transport policies and strategies are scrutinized under the framework of sustainable urban mobility paradigm to better understand the mobility predicament which have long stifled the quality of life of Istanbulites. The challenges are identified, recommendations are proposed, and prospects are put forward as to how to achieve sustainable urban mobility in Istanbul.},

It also needs to meet the demands of different user groups, including current and potential future users, in order to avoid opposition of the citizens and to support sustainable development decisions. While these requirements are well-known, conducting full surveys of user needs and preferences are tedious and costly, and the interests of different user groups may be contradictory. We therefore developed a methodology based on the prevalent Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is capable of dealing with the inconsistencies and uncertainties of users’ responses by applying an Interval Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP) through comparing the results of passengers to reference stakeholder groups. For a case study in Mersin, a coastal city in southern Turkey with 1.7 Million inhabitants, three groups were surveyed with questionnaires: 40 users of the public transport system, 40 non-users, and 17 experts. Based on interval pairwise comparison matrices, consisting of whole judgments of all groups, the IAHP methodology could attain a consensual preference ranking for a future public transportation system between the three groups. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the factor ranking was very stable.},

By using a tour-based modeling framework and highly detailed land use and travel data, this study attempts to add detail on the specific land use changes necessary to address different types of travel, and to develop a comparative framework by which the relative impact of travel time and urban form changes can be assessed. A discrete choice modeling framework adjusted for demographic factors and assessed the relative effect of travel time, costs, and urban form on mode choice and trip chaining characteristics for the three tour types. The tour based modeling approach increased the ability to understand the relative contribution of urban form, time, and costs in explaining mode choice and tour complexity for home and work related travel. Urban form at residential and employment locations, and travel time and cost were significant predictors of travel choice. Travel time was the strongest predictor of mode choice while urban form the strongest predictor of the number of stops within a tour. Results show that reductions in highway travel time are associated with less transit use and walking. Land use patterns where respondents work predicted mode choice for mid day and journey to work travel.},

Choice users select transit or automobile service when they view one option as superior, whereas captive users have only one travel option. Surprisingly, little is known about captivity effects on mode split models. This research examines the way transit service factors such as accessibility and connectivity relate to mode captivity and mode choice. Data for this investigation come from the Portland, Oregon, 1994 Household Activity and Travel Diary Survey, the Regional Land Information System for the Portland area, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy database, and the U.S. Department of Energy. Individual trip data were segmented into transit captive, automobile captive, and choice users based on information about private vehicle availability, transit connectivity, and distance from a transit stop. Traditional transit mode split models are compared with models that segment users into choice and captive groups. It was found that traditional models underestimate the variation in mode choice for captive users, while overestimating the attractiveness of transit for choice users. These results indicate that better transit forecasts can result if accessibility and connectivity are used to help identify captive users. Additionally, among choice transit users, differences in travel times between automobile and transit modes do little to influence mode selection, while walk access to transit has more effect than previously thought.},

	abstract = {The operation and planning of large-scale power systems are becoming more challenging with the increasing penetration of stochastic renewable generation. In order to minimize the decision risks in power systems with large amount of renewable resources, there is a growing need to model the short-term generation uncertainty. By producing a group of possible future realizations for certain set of renewable generation plants, scenario approach has become one popular way for renewables uncertainty modeling. However, due to the complex spatial and temporal correlations underlying in renewable generations, traditional model-based approaches for forecasting future scenarios often require extensive knowledge, while fitted models are often hard to scale. To address such modeling burdens, we propose a learning-based, data-driven scenario forecasts method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which is a class of deep-learning generative algorithms used for modeling unknown distributions. We firstly utilize an improved GANs with convergence guarantees to learn the intrinsic patterns and model the unknown distributions of (multiple-site) renewable generation time-series. Then by solving an optimization problem, we are able to generate forecasted scenarios without any scenario number and forecasting horizon restrictions. Our method is totally model-free, and could forecast scenarios under different level of forecast uncertainties. Extensive numerical simulations using real-world data from NREL wind and solar integration datasets validate the performance of proposed method in forecasting both wind and solar power scenarios.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	abstract = {Predicting passenger pickup/dropoff demands based on historical mobility trips has been of great importance towards better vehicle distribution for the emerging mobility-on-demand (MOD) services. Prior works focused on predicting next-step passenger demands at selected locations or hotspots. However, we argue that multi-step citywide passenger demands encapsulate both time-varying demand trends and global statuses, and hence are more beneficial to avoiding demand-service mismatching and developing effective vehicle distribution/scheduling strategies. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network solution to the prediction task. We employ the encoder-decoder framework based on convolutional and ConvLSTM units to identify complex features that capture spatiotemporal influences and pickup-dropoff interactions on citywide passenger demands. A novel attention model is incorporated to emphasize the effects of latent citywide mobility regularities. We evaluate our proposed method using real-word mobility trips (taxis and bikes) and the experimental results show that our method achieves higher prediction accuracy than the adaptations of the state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {There is a growing need to optimize mobility in medium to large-size cities. The use of a car for one-person trips is widely established as a common trend, which combined with the age of the vehicle fleet from many countries leads to high levels of pollution. Besides, the time wasted on commuting is more than significant for many people. Under these premises, it is paramount to understand the dynamics of mobility in every city. In this work, the problem of modeling and predicting transport demand in large cities with high spatio-temporal resolution is tackled. The city studied and its metropolitan area are subdivided into a new mobility mesh-grid, and transport demand is binned into short time intervals. The proposed Spatio-Temporal Mobility Demand Forecaster (ST-MDF) model is trained with real mobility demand data (such as taxi and bicycle rental), historical weather data (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and wind speed), and temporal information (e.g., weekday, time, and holiday) to predict mobility demand in every region of the mesh, for several forecast horizons. The experiments show that the ST-MDF model exhibits flexibility and robustness, while at the same time it outperforms the baseline models, such as a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, or the persistence and naive models.},
